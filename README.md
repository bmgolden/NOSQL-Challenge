# NOSQL-Challenge
Module 12 Challenge 
Brendan Golden 

Module 12 was a great adaptation of the concepts taught in class regarding NOSQL databases such as MongoDB and PyMongo. The assignment was extremely practical as it required the application of the entirety of the material that was presented in lecture. I did collaborate with Nick Ortega, Chris Rahal, and Wei Wang. 
The initial part of the assignment concerned the importation of the database file using the command prompt shell installed on the computer. Also, the initial portion of the module allowed us to practice the preemptory exploration process of setting up the database using the mongo client and exploring the various collections in the database using the built in commands within the imported python library. 

The second portion of the assignment was more involved as it required us to use some concepts of finding certain documents meeting certain criteria provided to use by using the find documents command and printing out the results using concepts that we have been using for a great portion of this course. We also had to manipulate some of the documents within the collection by incorporating the commands such as set, push, and unset. 

The third and final portion of the assignment was more complex as it required the application of more intricate methods such as the aggregate method as we needed to synthesize the specific query based off the specific requirements given to us, as well as the certain fields that we were supposed to select from each individual collection within the database. We had to use the pipeline method by simultaneously creating a match, group by and, sort query and find all of the results that match each of the individual criteria.
